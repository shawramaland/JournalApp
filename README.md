# JournalApp
I've created a straightforward code resembling a personal journal. It's a personal project aimed at improving my Java skills.

10/9/2023: I successfully made the code function as intended. It allows the user to write a title and an entry, much like maintaining a personal journal. There are still some additional features that need to be incorporated, but this marks a step forward i think.

11/9/2023: I introduced password-based user login security. Users now need to register a password before gaining access. However, I encountered an issue where the 'Main' in the com/github/shawarmaland folder and 'MainApp' in the directory were somewhat isolated. My next step is to consolidate these components and outline what comes next.

12/9/2023: I managed to integrated the login and registration processes upon the terminal startup, followed by introducing additional functionalities for handling entries, including addition, editing, viewing, and deletion. It performed as per my expectations. However, the next task on is to implement data storage for these and more other stuff that will be added soon. hopefully this will also go smoothly.

17/9/2023: I made modifications to the project by both adding and moving methods to other places. I successfully managed to store user registration data and login functionality as intended. However, there are some issues with storing entries that require fixes and adjustments.

18/9/2023: I've successfully resolved the problem related to updating an Entry for the journal project. Following this, I conducted a review of the codebase and identified some files that were no longer in use. As a result, I now have fewer files than before after this cleanup.
