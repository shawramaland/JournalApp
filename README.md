Just managed to make the code to run as intended and only write a title and Entry for it like you are writing a personal journal.
it still need some other stuff to be added however its a good step.

I added a password user and login security that before entering, it will need to register a password and after that you can login with the new password you just registard,
however i stumble upon an issue where the main in the util folder is and the MainApp in the directory are rather seperated, so as i just need to combine this toger and will write what would be next.
