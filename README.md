# JournalApp
I've created a straightforward code resembling a personal journal. It's a personal project aimed at improving my Java skills.

10/9/2023: I successfully made the code function as intended. It allows the user to write a title and an entry, much like maintaining a personal journal. There are still some additional features that need to be incorporated, but this marks a step forward i think.

11/9/2023: I introduced password-based user login security. Users now need to register a password before gaining access. However, I encountered an issue where the 'Main' in the com/github/shawarmaland folder and 'MainApp' in the directory were somewhat isolated. My next step is to consolidate these components and outline what comes next.
